AirBnB Clone
This repository contains resources that culminate into a full web application: the AirBnB clone. Listed below are some important building blocks of this project:

Command line Interpreter for backend object management
Data serialization/deserialization (Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file)
Abstracted data storage engine
Unittests for class and storage engine validation
Language: Python
Project Description
To create a sandboxed command line interface through which we can create, modify and delete objects in our file storage. This project currently only implements the back-end console. It is a complete web application, integrates database storage and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

Classes
AirBnB utilizes the following classes:

BaseModel
FileStorage
User
State
City
Amenity
Place
Review
Storage
The above classes and object data are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the [FileStorage] (./models/engine/file_storage.py) class.

Every time the backend is initialized, AirBnB creates an instance of the FileStorage class called Storage. The Storage object is loaded/re-loaded from any class instances stored in the JSON file airbnb_file.json. As class instances are created, updated, or deleted, the storage object is used to register corresponding chnages in the airbnb_file.json file.

Console
The console is a command line interpreter that facilitates the backend management of the AirBnB clone web app. It can be used to handle all classes utilized by the application.

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 
$
Alternatively, to use the AirBnB console in interactive mode, run the file console.py by itself:

$ ./console.py
While running in interactive mode, the console displays a prompt for input:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) 
To quit the console, input the command quit, or input an EOF signal (ctrl-D).

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
Console Commands
The AirBnB console supports the following commands:

create
Usage: create <class>
Creates a new instance of a given class. The class' ID is printed and timestamped. Then the created instance is saved to the file file.json.

Testing
Unittests for the AirBnB project are defined in the tests directory. To run the complete test suite in an instant, execute the following command:

$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:

$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
